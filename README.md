### Color Scheme
The application uses a purple gradient theme defined by CSS custom properties. You can customize colors by modifying the CSS variables in `style.css`:

```css
/* Primary gradient colors */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);

/* Text colors */
color: #2d3748; /* Dark gray for primary text */
color: #718096; /* Medium gray for secondary text */
```

### Layout Modifications
- **Grid columns**: Adjust `.format-grid` and `.features-grid` for different layouts
- **Spacing**: Modify padding and margin values throughout the stylesheet
- **Border radius**: Change the `border-radius` values for different corner styles

## Design Philosophy

The application follows modern web design principles:

- **Glass-morphism**: Semi-transparent elements with backdrop blur
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Smooth color transitions for visual appeal
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy using system fonts
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and semantic HTML

## Performance

- **Lightweight**: Pure HTML/CSS implementation with minimal dependencies
- **Fast loading**: No JavaScript frameworks or heavy libraries
- **Efficient CSS**: Optimized selectors and minimal redundancy
- **Print-friendly**: Dedicated print styles for clean output

## Future Enhancements
